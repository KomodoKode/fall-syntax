# expiramental-syntax

This is my first syntax theme, based off of Atomic-monokai-pro-syntax with only the colors modified. This should look *nothing* like atomic-monokai-pro-syntax.

Unlike most other themes, this theme aims to **reduce eye strain**, thus the design choice of warmer colors.

I hope you like it! :heart:

## Installation

This theme can be installed from within Atom or via the command:
```sh
$ apm install expiramental-syntax
```
After installation, you can activated by going to the **Settings > Themes** section and selecting it from the **Syntax Themes** drop-down menu.
