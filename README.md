# autumn-syntax

This is my first syntax theme, based off of (and originally forked from) [Atomic-monokai-pro-syntax][1]. Except now, this looks *nothing* like [atomic-monokai-pro-syntax][1].

Unlike most other themes, this theme aims to **reduce eye strain** using **warmer colors**, yet it's also designed to help the programmer **focus**, greying out comments and increasing contrast on function/class definitions.

It's a dark theme which looks great during the day *or* night and it helps **reduce energy consumption**.

I hope you like it! :heart:

## Installation

This theme can be installed from within Atom or via the command:
```sh
$ apm install autumn-syntax
```
After installation, you can activated by going to the **Settings > Themes** section and selecting it from the **Syntax Themes** drop-down menu.

## Creation and design

I took three different ways until deciding on how to make this theme

### Just make it redder

I loved [the monokai pro syntax theme][1] for [Atom](https://atom.io/). But just warming the colors isn't creative and **the result was ugly**.

So I chose a different way.

### Monochromatic red!

Yeah, um, there's not going to be space for contrast

### Get a reddy palette and edit that

So I used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to help me generate some colors. I selected the ones I like and kept on spamming <kbd>space</kbd> until I liked the palette.

Then I filled in the Less and kept on fine-tune and tweaked the colors until I liked them.

**NOTE**: plainly choosing the colors from a photo and smacking it here may seem nice but actually, it's not going to be well calibrated. The colors here are *meticulously* chosen with great care.

## FAQ

**Hey, did you steal some monokai colors!?**
A: No, great minds think alike
